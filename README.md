# ♠️♥️♣️♦️ Blackjack in Java ♦️♣️♥️♠️

Welcome to the repository of the **Blackjack in Java** project. This is an incredibly incomplete and abandoned Blackjack game implemented in Java, because, you know, nothing says "fun" like a Java card game, right? 😜

## ℹ️ Description

The **Blackjack in Java** project is a desperate (and failed) attempt to implement the famous card game Blackjack in Java. Play against the computer and find out what it's like to be defeated by poorly written code! 🃏💻

Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular casino card game where players try to achieve a score of 21 points or as close as possible without going over that amount, competing against the dealer. But here, you'll probably wonder why you bothered to try.

## ⚙️ Functionality

The game is implemented in a way that even an inexperienced Java programmer would be ashamed of. To start the game, run the `main` method in the `App.java` class. But, seriously, do you really want to do that?

## 👨‍💻 Technologies Used

- ☕**Java**♨️♨: Because, of course, choosing the worst language possible was essential for this deplorable project.

## 🃏 Cards and Suits

Why bother playing this game when you could be doing literally anything else? But, if you really want to waste your time, here are some examples of cards:

- **Ace of Spades**: 🂡
- **2 of Hearts**: 🂢
- **3 of Diamonds**: 🂣
- **King of Clubs**: 🂮

## 💬 Notes

This project is so incomplete and poorly done that not even the Garbage Collector wants anything to do with it. If for some reason you want to try to understand how this disaster was implemented, feel free to explore the code. But, honestly, you'll probably be better off just pretending this repository never existed.

- 🙋‍♂️ If you're a recruiter and you're looking at this, well, I'm sorry for you. Maybe you should reconsider your career choices.

This project is licensed under the MIT License (Can clone!). But, seriously, why would you want to do that?

Don't worry about the license, this project is just a desperate attempt to create some fun in a programming language that generally doesn't inspire much joy. So, go ahead, do whatever you want with it! Or, you know, just go do something more productive. 😅
